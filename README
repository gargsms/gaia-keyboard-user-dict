There are a few files that are helpful in the User Dictionary implementation for Gaia Keyboard in Firefox OS.

The basic TST script is taken from https://github.com/jandre/js-ternary-tree/blob/master/ternary-tree.js
Various modifications have been made for our purposes.

You can use node.js for running the TSTPerfTest.js file and check for the performance of the current implementation.

On my 2.5GHz, Quad-Core processor and 4Gigs of RAM, the TST generation times are about 50 - 60 ms for 5000 words. The search times were within 10ms.
The performance measures are not very nice. The generation time will suffer quite a lot when using completely randomised set of inputs. The present inputs are only pseudo-random.
But, for an average user the User Dictionary will hardly exceed 500 - 600 words (maybe that is a hyperbole), so we can safely assume that everything is fine.
